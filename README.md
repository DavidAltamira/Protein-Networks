# Protein-Networks
Final project of the course Biological Dataset for  Computational Physics in the Physics of Data master degree at University of Padova.

## Description
The study of complex networks have become to a powerful tool for understanding any type of interaction in any field of science. In biology, networks are used, among other things, to study protein-protein interactions (PPI), where proteins are the nodes and interaction are the links. In the present work we use Escherichia coli and Homo sapiens interactomes to analyze the network topology. We explore the three most robust measures: average shortest path length, clustering coefficient and degree distribution. These measures allow to determine that networks do not tend to form dense clusters so diseases and information spread slowly.
